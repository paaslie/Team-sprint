                Our client, Team Sprint, is a team of four Norwegian speed skaters. We were 
                introduced to this client by Carina, who is one of the speed skaters in Team Sprint. 
                As the name of the team implies, the four athletes specialize in the sprint distances 
                of speed skating, which are 100, 500 and 1000 meters.
                Team Sprint has a close cooperation with the Norwegian Skating 
                Federation and the Norwegian National Sprint Team. Their goal is to provide
                sprinters that find themselves on the second highest level with the opportunity to 
                develop and climb the last few steps up to the highest level of sprint in Norway. Team 
                Sprint depends on the support from sponsors and this website will be used as a resource 
                for reaching out to potential sponsors and promoting their current sponsors. We will
                create a website called Team Sprint Skøyter.

            <h2> Purpose and goals</h2>
            <p>
                Because of the Norwegian tradition of long-distance speed skating, Team Sprint seeks to 
                educate and inspire Norwegian coaches and young speed skaters into wanting to specialize 
                in sprint. This is also seen as the main purpose of this website. Our goal to fulfill the 
                main purpose is to create a platform for Team Sprint to share their knowledge about sprint
                training. This will be done through publishing training programs, exercises, and thoughts 
                about sprint technique. In other words, we need to provide users with the opportunity to
                watch videos of the exercises that are mentioned in the training programs. Another goal 
                to fulfill such a purpose is to give a description of Team Sprint´s work and goals, a 
                short introduction of each athlete, and provide updates from competitions and training 
                camps. To fulfill the secondary purpose of reaching potential sponsors and promoting the
                current sponsors, our goal is to include a lot of photos and videos that show off 
                sponsor products and logos, give a brief description of every sponsor, and provide 
                Team Sprint´s contact information.

                <li>All the pages of the website should have the same clean look,
                    mainly using the colors #FFFFFF and #033EA7 (the colors of Team 
                    Sprint’s logo). This to ensure that the website appears 
                    professional and easy to navigate.
                    </li><br>
                <li>The embedded Instagram photos and videos 
                    should include the caption.
                </li><br>
                <li>The logos of Team Sprint’s sponsors, sectioned in the footnote 
                    of every page, should function as links to the respective sponsors’ 
                    own websites. These websites should open in new tabs.
                </li>
