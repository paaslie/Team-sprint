            <h2> The client</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Client name: Team Sprint</li>
                <li> Contact persons: Arne Skuterud (Head coach of Team Sprint) & Carina Jagtøyen </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our client, Team Sprint, is a team of four Norwegian speed skaters. We were 
                introduced to this client by Carina, who is one of the speed skaters in Team Sprint. 
                As the name of the team implies, the four athletes specialize in the sprint distances 
                of speed skating, which are 100, 500 and 1000 meters.
                Team Sprint has a close cooperation with the Norwegian Skating 
                Federation and the Norwegian National Sprint Team. Their goal is to provide
                sprinters that find themselves on the second highest level with the opportunity to 
                develop and climb the last few steps up to the highest level of sprint in Norway. Team 
                Sprint depends on the support from sponsors and this website will be used as a resource 
                for reaching out to potential sponsors and promoting their current sponsors. We will
                create a website called Team Sprint Skøyter.
            </p>

            <h2> Purpose and goals</h2>
            <p>
                Because of the Norwegian tradition of long-distance speed skating, Team Sprint seeks to 
                educate and inspire Norwegian coaches and young speed skaters into wanting to specialize 
                in sprint. This is also seen as the main purpose of this website. Our goal to fulfill the 
                main purpose is to create a platform for Team Sprint to share their knowledge about sprint
                training. This will be done through publishing training programs, exercises, and thoughts 
                about sprint technique. In other words, we need to provide users with the opportunity to
                watch videos of the exercises that are mentioned in the training programs. Another goal 
                to fulfill such a purpose is to give a description of Team Sprint´s work and goals, a 
                short introduction of each athlete, and provide updates from competitions and training 
                camps. To fulfill the secondary purpose of reaching potential sponsors and promoting the
                current sponsors, our goal is to include a lot of photos and videos that show off 
                sponsor products and logos, give a brief description of every sponsor, and provide 
                Team Sprint´s contact information.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2> Audience</h2>
            <p> The main audience of this website will be coaches and athletes from different speed 
                skating clubs and teams in Norway. This group will use the website to learn about sprint 
                technique and to find inspiration from exercises that contribute to improve the 
                attributes that are essential for sprint on ice. The audience also consists of 
                those who are interested in following the journey and results of the Team Sprint

            <h2> Content of the website and Organization</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>“About Us”</b>
                    <p>This section will introduce Team Sprint to the users through a short 
                        description of their work and their goals. Additionally, each of the 
                        athletes and coaches will be presented with a portrait, a few words 
                        about themselves and a list of their personal records. This page will 
                        provide other speed skaters, coaches, supporters, and potential sponsors 
                        with the opportunity to get to know Team Sprint on a deeper level.

                        thoughts and explanations regarding sprint technique. These three pages
                        will help us fulfill the purpose of educating and inspiring Norwegian 
                        coaches and speed skaters and might therefore be seen as the most 
                        important pages of the website. This section may also be found very 
                        interesting for speed skating enthusiasts that want to learn more about 
                        sprint training. Team Sprint would like the “Exercises”-page to be organized

            <h2> Functional and Non-Functional Requirements </h2>

            <ol>

                    “Sprint Training”, “Updates and Results” and “Our Sponsors”.
                </li><br>
                <li>When clicking on “Sprint Training” in the navigation bar, 
                    a dropdown menu containing the options “Training Programs”,

                    videos of the exercises, located in the “Exercises”-page. The
                    videos should open in new tabs so that the users don’t have to 
                    find their way back to the training program.

                <li>All the pages of the website should have the same clean look,
                    mainly using the colors #FFFFFF and #033EA7 (the colors of Team 
                    Sprint’s logo). This to ensure that the website appears 
                    professional and easy to navigate.

                <li>The logos of Team Sprint’s sponsors, sectioned in the footnote 
                    of every page, should function as links to the respective sponsors’ 
                    own websites. These websites should open in new tabs.
                </li>
            </ol>
